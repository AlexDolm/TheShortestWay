#Shortest path (Maps)
ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
This is a mobile application that builds the shortest path passing through several points. 
The user enters the addresses that he needs to visit in the right order (all addresses are reflected on the map), 
and the program builds the shortest path.
Update: The ability to determine the user's location is implemented. Yandex Map has been added to the application using the CocoaPods.
